But there are many blue recipes that don&#39;t actually have the word <em>&quot;blue&quot;</em> in the name or description. Glazy also has many blue glazes contributed by users from other countries, and they have written <em>&quot;blue&quot;</em> in their own language.</p><p>So in general, it is much better to search by the multilingual <em>Type</em> &amp; <em>Subtype</em> fields (e.g. &quot;Glaze -&gt; Blue&quot;) rather than by keywords.
