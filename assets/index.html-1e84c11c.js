Recipes specify the <em>proportion</em> of one material to another. When mixed together, the recipe&#39;s materials form a new type of material- a clay suitable for throwing, a beautiful, shiny glaze, or a colorful underglaze.</p><p>The recipe below is a classic recipe called <strong>&quot;Leach 4321&quot;</strong>. <strong>Leach 4321</strong> is often used as an example because its recipe is very simple and it works well:</p><h4 id="leach-4321" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#leach-4321" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Leach 4321</h4><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Leach 4321"></p><p>Because the recipe lists the <em>proportion</em> of ingredients, you can think of the amounts as <em>percentages</em>. <strong>Leach 4321</strong> is a recipe made up of:</p><ul><li><strong>40%</strong> Potash Feldspar,</li><li><strong>30%</strong> Silica,</li><li><strong>20%</strong> Whiting, and</li><li><strong>10%</strong> Kaolin,</li></ul><p>For a combined total of <strong>100%</strong>.</p><p>It is not unusual to see recipes that do not total to 100. Often, recipes in workshops are written down as <strong>batches</strong> rather than 100% proportions. For example, Leach 4321 can also be written as:</p><ul><li><strong>4000g</strong> Potash Feldspar,</li><li><strong>3000g</strong> Silica,</li><li><strong>2000g</strong> Whiting, and</li><li><strong>1000g</strong> Kaolin,</li></ul><p>For a combined total of <strong>10,000g</strong>.</p><p>It&#39;s important to realize that <em>this is the same recipe as listed above</em>, just multiplied by 100 and specifying a unit of measurement. Potters often write down recipes in <strong>batch sizes</strong> that they work with to make mixing glazes easier. A batch size of <strong>10,000g</strong> (like the one above) is often used when making up a large bucket of glaze or clay.</p><p><em>Note: All recipes are measured by weight, not volume!</em></p><h2 id="recipe-basics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#recipe-basics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Recipe Basics</h2><p>Learn how to bookmark, print, export, and make batches of recipes:</p>',17),T=e("iframe",{width:"640",height:"360",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8-thIhLdBk",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:""},null,-1),G=e("h2",{id:"create-a-recipe",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#create-a-recipe","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),a(" Create a Recipe")],-1),B=e("h2",{id:"batches",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#batches","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),a(" Batches")],-1),M=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"batch"),a(", "),e("em",null,"noun")],-1),q={start:"2"},L=e("em",null,"made a batch of cookie dough; mixed a batch of cement.",-1),H={href:"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/batch",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},I=e("p",null,[a("Because recipes list "),e("em",null,"proportions"),a(" of ingredients, no units of measurement are used.

## Hazards

_09/2016 Note: This is a new feature. If a recipe material is not
listed, that material's data has not yet been added. Some materials only
have GHS ratings, while others only have HMIS ratings. Warnings differ
between systems and countries. Glazy does not take any responsibility
for accuracy of linked SDS information. Contact your ceramics supplier
for safety information for your specific materials._

You must wear a NIOSH certified mask whenever mixing ceramic materials.
All materials should be handled and fired in well-ventilated areas to
avoid the risk of inhalation.

Lack of a warning does NOT mean that a material is safe.

From hazard warnings alone it is difficult to determine **when** and **how** a
given material may be harmful. Some materials might be relatively safe
to use when making glazes, but toxic when volatized during firing or
leached from a non-durable fired glaze. Other materials might be
relatively safe in a durable fired glaze, but extremely toxic in raw
form in the studio. It is up to the individual to understand the risks
of each material and take necessary precautions.
