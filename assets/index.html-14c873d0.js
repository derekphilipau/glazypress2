Uploading images of glazes, verifying existing recipes, and sharing your own recipes helps Glazy become a more trustworthy source of ceramics information.</p><p><strong>Glazy will always remain open and free.</strong> But the Glazy code takes many hours each month to write and maintain, as does providing support to users, creating tests, and importing new data into the database. The web servers that Glazy runs on cost more as Glazy grows. Therefore I am adding some features that are &quot;Patron-only&quot;, enabled only for those who financially contribute. Those who contribute help to support the thousands of teachers, students, and all those unable to contribute.</p><h3 id="free-for-student-teachers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#free-for-student-teachers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Free for Student &amp; Teachers</h3><p>If you are currently a student or teacher in Ceramics or a related Visual Arts department, simply register with a .edu email address and you will automatically be given 12 months of Patron status for free.
