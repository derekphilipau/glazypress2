Even for well-known glazes, it’s important to first make a few small tests. For these tests, use 50g or 100g of material and apply the test glaze to a number of different clay bodies. If a test comes out well, mix a larger batch of 1-2Kg. 1Kg is enough material to glaze small cups, 2Kg is a good amount for small bowls. These larger tests should reveal any problems with glaze suspension, application (cracking, peeling, etc.), and fired glaze defects. Once you have some nice results with 1Kg, you can finally move on to a big bucket of 5-10Kg.</p><img src="'+l+'" title="Sizes for glaze batches."><h2 id="batch-calculator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#batch-calculator" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Batch Calculator</h2><p>The batch calculator simply multiplies each ingredient amount. It is unit-independent. In the example shown, it does not matter if we are making 2000 grams, kilograms, pounds or even tonnes of glaze.</p><p>Note that additive materials such as coloring oxides are calculated in addition to the batch amount.</p><p>In the example below, the <em>base recipe</em> is calculated to 1000 units (grams, pounds, whatever), while the <em>additional materials</em> (Tin Oxide and Yellow Iron Oxide) are added on top of 1000.</p><img src="'+n+'" title="The Glazy Batch Calculator"><h2 id="sieves" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sieves" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sieves</h2><p>For “natural” glazes containing large-grained materials or ashes, or in cases where homogeneity is not a concern, it’s fine to use a larger screen of 60-80 mesh. But in all other cases it&#39;s good to use 120 mesh or smaller. Small mesh size is very important for glazes that contain small amounts of very important materials such as coloring oxides (e.g. cobalt and iron). But it’s also important to ensure that materials are adequately broken up and mixed (such as clays).</p><p>Below you can see two tests of the same batch of glaze fired in the same kiln. The first test was applied after passing the materials three times through an 80 mesh screen. The second test is the result of passing that same glaze once more through a 120 mesh screen.</p><img src="'+c+'" title="Left:  80 mesh sieve, Right: 120 mesh sieve"><h2 id="scales" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scales" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scales</h2><p>Weight measuring scales come in a wide range of types and prices. Purchasing a scale is a trade-off between cost, resolution and capacity. In general, scales that can weigh larger amounts of materials have lower resolution (e.g. 1 gram), while scales that have higher resolution (e.g. 0.01 grams) can only weigh small amounts.</p><p>For weighing small amounts of glaze materials (for example, 50 and 100 gram test batches), it is very important to use a scale that has a readability to at least 0.1 grams. (Some glaze materials such as cobalt are very strong, and a difference of even 0.1 grams in a 100 gram batch will have a noticeable impact.) Ideally, your test scale will have a capacity of over 100 grams and readability of 0.01 grams.</p><p>Note: Just because a scale has a high resolution (e.g. 0.01 grams) does not mean it has high accuracy. Price is usually a good indication of accuracy, so it&#39;s best to get the most expensive scale that you can reasonably afford.</p><img src="'+h+'" title="Simple balance scales."><p>The Ohaus Scout Pro SP4001 and SP202 digital scales during calibration.

All materials should be handled in well-ventilated area to avoid the risk of inhalation. For more information about the hazards of mixing ceramic materials, see the article <a href="/downloads/pdf/goldberg_studiodust-final.pdf">Studio Dust by Mark Goldberg</a>.</p><p>For test glazes, try to find re-useable containers that fit your seives like these plastic restaurant soup bowls with lids.
