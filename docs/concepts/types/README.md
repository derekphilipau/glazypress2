# Clay & Glaze Types

Ceramics books use numerous approaches to categorizing glazes, from color (white, black, etc.) to predominant coloring oxide (iron, cobalt, etc.) to firing temperature.

One must be careful when categorizing recipes. If categories are too specific it becomes more difficult to search,
while very broad categories become less meaningful.

Glazy categorizes clay bodies by type and then usage, for instance: _Porcelain - Slipcasting_

For glazes, Glazy adopts the format of John Britt's
<a href="http://johnbrittpottery.com/shop/the-complete-guide-to-high-fire-glazes-glazing-firing-at-cone-10/">The Complete Guide to High-Fire Glazes, Glazing & Firing at Cone 10</a>
The categories in this book are based on a combination of glaze color, coloring oxide, surface and firing type.

## Glaze Sub-Types

### [Clear](https://glazy.org/search?base_type=460&type=470)

Transparent glaze, often used to highlight underlying clay or decoration.

<img src="./img/types/clear.jpg" alt="Clear Glaze" width="300">

Clear glazes are a type of "Base Glaze". They don't have any colorants or opacifiers. They are usually Glossy, but can also have a Satin finish.

Clear glazes are located in the middle "Bright" region of the Stull Chart.
When too much Alumina or Silica is added to a Clear glaze, then it often changes to a Matte Glaze.

![Clear Glazes plotted on the Stull Chart](./img/stull.jpg)

In the Silica:Alumina Stull Chart above, you can see that most Clear glazes fall within the middle "Bright" region.

### [White, Off-White](https://glazy.org/search?base_type=460&type=480)

Glazes with varying shades of white. Usually don't contain additives like colorants, but may include opacifiers like Tin & Zircopax.

Green is the typical colour of Oribe ware, along with white. The original Chinese green was a smooth, even colour like celadon. Oribe, however, tried to use different shades of more natural green, in order to reflect green mountains or riverside scenes. For the brilliant green color, wares are fired using oxidation at 1220 degrees Celsius.

### [Matte](https://glazy.org/search?base_type=460&type=860)

There are a few ways to get matte glazes, but one must be careful not to assume a glaze is truly matte just because of its surface. Underfired glazes can often appear matte, but they may have issues and be unsuitable for functional use.

#### [Ash: Nuka](https://glazy.org/search?base_type=460&type=1070)

Traditional Japanese rice-husk ash glaze.

This recipe is from a comment by John Baymore in Ceramic Arts Daily:
> "Nuka" is the Japanese word for the husk (or hull) of the rice kernel. It is a by-product of the milling of white rice. The Japanese version is from a short grain rice.

> Potter parlance (in Japanese) uses this term for glazes based upon rice HUSK ash (not rice straw ash....... different chemical composition). The agricultural waste is piled in the fields and is then burned. The piles smolder more than burn, and a good ash for glaze use is actually dark grey to black. You don't want it to burn cleanly. This color comes from carbon residue in the ash. SO the ash has a high L.O.I. The chemical composition of rice husk ash (after L.O.I.) is almost colloidally fine silica. (TJR I'd call it more of a semi-gloss.)

> Nuka glazes are high calcium fluxed glazes (from the washed wood ash) what use the rice husk ash for a lot of the silica content, and bringing in the silica in a very fine particle size. They fire a bluish white and are slightly milky opaque where thicker due to the unmelted silica particles.
