# Clay & Glaze Types

Ceramics books use numerous approaches to categorizing glazes, from color (white, black, etc.) to predominant coloring oxide (iron, cobalt, etc.) to firing temperature.

One must be careful when categorizing recipes.  If categories are too specific it becomes more difficult to search,
while very broad categories become less meaningful.

Glazy categorizes clay bodies by type and then usage, for instance: *Porcelain - Slipcasting*

For glazes, Glazy adopts the format of John Britt's
<a href="http://johnbrittpottery.com/shop/the-complete-guide-to-high-fire-glazes-glazing-firing-at-cone-10/">The Complete Guide to High-Fire Glazes, Glazing & Firing at Cone 10</a>
The categories in this book are based on a combination of glaze color, coloring oxide, surface and firing type.

## Glaze Sub-Types

### [Clear](https://glazy.org/search?base_type=460&type=470)

Transparent glaze, often used to highlight underlying clay or decoration.

<img src="./img/types/clear.jpg" alt="Clear Glaze" width="300">

Clear glazes are a type of "Base Glaze".  They don't have any colorants or opacifiers.  They are usually Glossy, but can also have a Satin finish.

Clear glazes are located in the middle "Bright" region of the Stull Chart.
When too much Alumina or Silica is added to a Clear glaze, then it often changes to a Matte Glaze.

![Clear Glazes plotted on the Stull Chart](./img/stull.jpg)

In the Silica:Alumina Stull Chart above, you can see that most Clear glazes fall within the middle "Bright" region.


### [White, Off-White](https://glazy.org/search?base_type=460&type=480)

Glazes with varying shades of white.  Usually don't contain additives like colorants, but may include opacifiers like Tin & Zircopax.

For the brilliant green color, wares are fired using oxidation at 1220 degrees Celsius.
