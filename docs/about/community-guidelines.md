# Glazy Community Guidelines

These Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of Glazy. Don’t forget that your use of Glazy is subject to these Community Guidelines and our [Terms of Service](./terms-of-service).

## Things to do

### Play nice

We’re a global community of many types of people, who all have the right to feel comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe, or see what you see. So, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members.

### Only upload photos that you have created.

Respect the copyright of others. This means don’t steal photos that other people have shared and pass them off as your own.

### Moderate your content.

All content on Glazy, whether public or private, has to be appropriately moderated.  Glazy is a place for content related to ceramics.  Any content not related to ceramics, including copyrighted, racist, mature (nudity, gore), or otherwise offensive material, does not belong on Glazy.

### Link back to Glazy when you post Glazy content elsewhere.

Glazy makes it possible to post content hosted on Glazy to other web sites. Pages on other web sites that display content hosted on Glazy should provide a link from each photo or video back to its page on Glazy. This provides a way to get more information about the content and the author, and centralizes discussions of the topic in Glazy, benefiting the community as a whole.

## Things not to do

Here’s the deal: We like to give second chances. However, when we discover you stepping across any of the lines listed below, we will take action, which may mean muting or deleting your account with or without warning.

### Don’t upload photos that aren’t yours.

This includes other people’s photos and/or stuff you’ve copied or collected from around the Internet. Accounts that consist of such collections may be deleted at any time.

### Don’t violate copyright laws

If you see photos that you’ve created in another member’s account, don’t panic. This is probably just a misunderstanding and not malicious. A good first step is to comment on their recipe or post and politely ask them to remove it. If that doesn’t work, you can file a notice with Glazy.

### Don’t harass other users

Glazy is not a venue for you to harass, abuse, spam, impersonate, or intimidate others. So, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other users.

Glazy has a zero-tolerance policy towards attacking a person or group based on, but is not limited to, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. Here are steps you can take to report these behaviors to Glazy and to block anyone on Glazy.

We do not tolerate spam, period. This includes, but is not limited to, excessive favoriting, excessive commenting, deceptive tagging, deceptive titles and descriptions, or resource abuse.

## Muting

Users who violate Glazy's Community Guidelines or Terms of Service will be muted.

### What happens when you are muted

When you are muted, you're told via email telling you the reason.  Muting means you will not be allowed to comment on posts or recipes or create new posts for one month.  You will still have full access to your private recipes.  You can still create new recipes and upload photos.  But you are not allowed to engage with the Glazy community via comments and posts.

### Second muting

If, after being muted for one month, a Glazy member continues to violate Glazy's Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, that member will be permanently muted.

### Further actions

If a Glazy member uploads content in violation of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, including copyrighted, racist, mature (nudity, gore), or otherwise offensive material, the member's account will be deleted, and the member will be permanently banned from Glazy.  A copy of all recipes belonging to that member will be sent to them in an email.

## In Conclusion

If you don’t feel that you can abide by our Community Guidelines as outlined above, maybe Glazy isn’t for you. We’ve crafted these guidelines to ensure that everyone within the Glazy community has a good time.
